Methodology
===========

Describe the methodology to calculate everything.
Break into different sections.
Give Intro


Here, we will put a flowchart or schematics to describe the entire workflow. This will be done last.


	1. :ref:`Expander cycle <meth-expander>`: decription.
	
	2. :ref:`Steady State <meth-ss>`: some more relevant description.

	3. Operating Maps

	4. :ref:`Transient <meth-transient>`: some more relevant description.


Components
----------

The following links describe the methodology to **calculate the different components separately**:

- :ref:`Mass flow rate <meth-mdot>`: relies on sonic flow and choke nozzle-throat conditions.

- :ref:`Pressure drop <meth-pressuredrop>`: general expressions for static, acceleration, and form losses.

- :ref:`Pipe <meth-pipe>`: steady-state and transient calculations based on inlet-outlet relations.

- :ref:`Turbopump <meth-turbopump>`: steady-state solution of the pump and turbine components via shaft work.
